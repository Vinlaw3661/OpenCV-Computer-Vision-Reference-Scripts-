# OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Reference-Scripts-
This repository hosts a collection of reference scripts using OpenCV, catering to introductory and intermediate levels of understanding in computer vision. The scripts cover fundamental concepts and practical implementations, offering clear examples for various vision tasks such as image processing, object detection, feature extraction, and more. Each script is extensively commented, aiding comprehension and serving as a resource for learners and developers navigating through OpenCV functionalities.

# Key Focus Areas:

* Introductory to intermediate-level computer vision scripts.
* Clear examples and implementations for different vision tasks.
* Extensive comments and explanations in the code for better understanding.
* Contributions and enhancements are welcomed to enrich the repository.

# Target Audience:

* Beginners and intermediate learners in computer vision.
* Developers seeking practical examples using OpenCV for vision-related projects.
* Individuals interested in comprehensible code explanations for vision algorithms.
Purpose:

The aim of this repository is to serve as a learning and reference hub for those delving into OpenCV for computer vision applications. It provides easily understandable scripts and explanations to facilitate the comprehension and application of vision algorithms.
